3. By default spring security has in build memory with
username:user
password :random UID


EVERY USER TO CONTAIN:
-------------------------
username
password(encoded)
role
authorities   -> recommended


How to ADD new user to inmemory db:
-------------------------------------------
-> override the userDetailsService method  
  @Override
    @Bean
    protected UserDetailsService userDetailsService() {
        UserDetails annaSmithUser = User.builder()
                .username("user1")
                .password(passwordEncoder.encode("password"))
                .roles("STUDENT") // ROLE_STUDENT
                .build();

        UserDetails lindaUser = User.builder()
                .username("user2")
                .password(passwordEncoder.encode("password123"))
                .roles("ADMIN") // ROLE_ADMIN
                .build();

        UserDetails tomUser = User.builder()
                .username("user3")
                .password(passwordEncoder.encode("password123"))
                .roles("AGENT") // ROLE_ADMINTRAINEE
                .build();

        return new InMemoryUserDetailsManager(
                annaSmithUser,
                lindaUser,
                tomUser
        );

    }
}



-> FOR EVERY USER THERE IS A ROLE
-> Every Role has permissions or authorities
-> Permission can be like:
product:read
product:write
catalog:read
catalog:write
Every role is configured with set of permissions
One user can be configured with multiple Roles

if creds which we are using for the basic auth used has the same role as configued with the api ====> the  call is alowed
if not 403 is thrown

-> 401 : when user name and password is wrong
-> 403: user name and pass is correct but the user doesnt have persmission

"/product" API can be called only the users  that has "ADMIN" as the role.
There are two roles in the application:
1.ADMIN
2.AGENT
1.user1 is associated with ADMIN
2.user2 is associated with AGENT
1.creds for user1 : user1 , password123
2.creds for user2 : user2 , password123



For Role based authnetication:
-----------------------------------------
Add the line   
antMatchers("/api/**").hasRole("STUDENT") SO THAT ONLY USER WITH ROLE 'STUDENT' can able to access the API.

  @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
                .authorizeRequests()
                .antMatchers("/", "index", "/css/*", "/js/*").permitAll()
                .antMatchers("/v1/products/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
                .anyRequest()
                .authenticated()
                .and()
                .httpBasic();
    }

 @Override
  protected UserDetailsService userDetailsService() {
        UserDetails user1 = User.builder()
                .username("user1")
                .password(passwordEncoder.encode("password123"))
                .roles("ADMIN") 
                .build();

        return new InMemoryUserDetailsManager(
                user1
        );

    }
                
                
   which means only user1 can able to access the /v1/products/** calls.
   any role based failures leads to 403
    


after the above configuration
the get call wprks as expected byt the post call failed with 403 even though user, role, and creds are correct.
this is due to csrf token
we need to disable this

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
                .csrf().disable() // TODO:  
                .authorizeRequests()
                .antMatchers("/", "index", "/css/*", "/js/*").permitAll()
                .antMatchers("/api/**").hasRole(STUDENT.name())
                .anyRequest()
                .authenticated()
                .and()
                .httpBasic();
    }
    
    
 if you disable then we can make the post calls
