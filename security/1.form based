1.by default there is no security so all apis can be called directly.


2.as soon as the dependency tag is added:

   <dependency>
	        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
	        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
	</dependency>

	the application expects authorization if not the app throws 401 or expects form based authentication 
	{
    "timestamp": "2021-05-06T13:13:50.923+0000",
    "status": 401,
    "error": "Unauthorized",
    "message": "Unauthorized",
    "path": "/api/v1/students/1"
}


for password refer the spring boot console:
username : user
Using generated security password: 6548f41f-c138-4468-9120-fc90aba5cb7e

Try http://localhost:8076/api/v1/students/1 in the browser

provide user name and password one time and access all the apis
login url : http://localhost:8076/login is auto generated

logout url: http://localhost:8076/logout for logout  

refer the network section and the diagram
